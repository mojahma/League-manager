Recent Form:

Weighted points from the last 10 matches (recent matches have higher weight).

Head-to-Head Records:

Historical performance between the two teams.

Team Strength:

Goals scored/conceded per game compared to the league average.

Points efficiency (points per game ratio to the maximum possible).

League Position Difference:

Advantage for teams higher in the league table.

Home Advantage:

Teams playing at home have a slight advantage.

Fixture Congestion:

Adjusts predictions for teams with multiple matches in a short period (fatigue impact).

Data Persistence
League, team, and fixture data are saved to a JSON file (league_data.json).

Data is automatically loaded when the application starts.

Use the Save Data option to manually save changes.
